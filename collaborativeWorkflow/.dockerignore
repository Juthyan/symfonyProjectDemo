# Ignore the configuration directories themselves,
# as the Dockerfile copies only specific files from them
# REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT THESE TWO LINES:
# /docker/
# /nginx/

# PHP dependencies (only composer.json is needed, vendor is installed in stage 1)
# Although 'vendor' is handled by multi-stage, excluding it here prevents copying
# a potentially massive local folder during the 'COPY .' command.
/vendor/

# Configuration files only needed locally
# symfony.lock is needed for Stage 1, but we don't want the local copy slowing down 'COPY .'
# (The Dockerfile copies it specifically in the first stage)
